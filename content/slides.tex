            \item Medium-sized dataset for performance optimizations: $\num{500}$ particles
            \item Large dataset for final simulation: $\num{4000}$ particles
        \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{.csv} file format: the first line contains header information, followed by the actual data:

	\end{minted}
    \item The values are in the following units: mass in [$M_\odot$], positions in [$\si{\parsec}$], and velocities in [$\frac{\si{\parsec}}{\si{\year}}$].
    \item Data must be stored and processed in double precision (FP64).

  Mandatory:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Visualize the data using \link{https://www.paraview.org/}{ParaView}.
      \item Create a \texttt{.vtp} file at each visualization step, containing the current state of the simulation: particle mass, position, velocity, acceleration, and kinetic, potential, and total energy of the system.
      \item Create a single \texttt{.pvd} file for the \textbf{entire} simulation, referencing all the \texttt{.vtp} files along with their corresponding time steps.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  \pause
  Optional (easier for debugging):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Live visualization during the actual simulation.
    \item In \texttt{C++}, for example, visualize the $\dots$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bodies using \link{https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl}{PCL}.
        \item Energies using \link{https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp}{matplotlib-cpp}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Important:} Other visualization libraries can be used here, but the final submission must be compilable without them.

    \frametitle{General Recommendations - 1}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Your simulation should have a progress indicator (e.g., console output every \SI{10}{\percent} of the simulation).
    \item Use an IDE (Visual Studio Code, CLion, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) and its features such as profilers, debuggers, auto-formatting, linters, etc.
    \item Use an automated build system like CMake or Maven.
    \item Document your code (for us \textbf{and} for yourself!) using tools like \link{https://doxygen.nl/}{Doxygen}/\link{https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javadoc-tool.html}{JavaDoc}.
    \item Make the installation, usage of your program, and verification of the requirements as easy as possible for the user.
    \item Test your program on the target system, the bwCloud (it must be runnable on Linux (keyword: paths: \mintinline{text}{/} vs \mintinline{text}{\})!).
    \item Questions can be asked directly in the \link{\urlIliasForumGeneral}{ILIAS forum}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{General Recommendations - 2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For \textbf{Windows users}, to avoid headaches due to different line endings on Linux and Windows, use\link{https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings}{}:
    \mintinline{text}{git config --global core.autocrlf true}
    \item If you are using \texttt{C++}: objects allocated with \mintinline{c++}{new} are \textbf{not} automatically released (better: use \mintinline{c++}{std::unique_ptr/std::shared_ptr} if necessary)!
    \item If you are using Java, avoid \enquote{boxed types} as much as possible:\\
    \mintinline{java}{double} vs. \mintinline{java}{Double} or \mintinline{java}{double[]} vs. \mintinline{java}{ArrayList<Double>}!
    \item Another tip for Java users: avoid using \mintinline{java}{Math.pow} in performance-critical code!
%     \item Another tip for Java users:
%     \begin{minted}[escapeinside=||,mathescape=true]{java}
% final double x = |$\dots$|;
% final double r = Math.pow(x, -2.5);
%     \end{minted}
%     is significantly slower in Java (for unclear reasons) than
%     \begin{minted}[escapeinside=||,mathescape=true]{java}
% final double x = |$\dots$|;
% final double r = 1.0 / Math.sqrt(x * x * x * x * x);
%     \end{minted}
    \item The runtime of your own code can be determined most easily using \mintinline{bash}{time}: \\[-.7em]
    {
        \small
        \begin{minted}{bash}
time java -jar simulate.jar --file data.csv --dt 10 --t_end 100 --vs 2
        \end{minted}
    }%
    \vspace*{-1.75em}
    \item If only an IPv6 address is available on the bwCloud, use \texttt{mvn -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true package} to build your Java programs. 
    \item In the Barnes-Hut algorithm, pay attention that the large black hole isn't located at the intersection point of all eight quadrants.
